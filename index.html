        <h3 class="text-primary">Tokyo (東京, Tōkyō) is Japan's capital and the world's most populous metropolis. It is also one of Japan's 47 prefectures, consisting of 23 central city wards and multiple cities, towns and villages west of the city center. The Izu and Ogasawara Islands are also part of Tokyo.</h3>

          <p class="text-secondary">Today, Tokyo offers a seemingly unlimited choice of shopping, entertainment, culture and dining to its visitors. The city's history can be appreciated in districts such as Asakusa and in many excellent museums, historic temples and gardens. Contrary to common perception, Tokyo also offers a number of attractive green spaces in the city center and within relatively short train rides at its outskirts.</p>

            <p class="text-primary">Tradition collides with pop culture in Tokyo, where you can reverently wander ancient temples before rocking out at a karaoke bar. Wake up before the sun to catch the lively fish auction at the Toyosu Market, then refresh with a walk beneath the cherry blossom trees that line the Sumida River. Spend some time in the beautiful East Gardens of the Imperial Palace, then brush up on your Japanese history at the Edo-Tokyo Museum. Don’t forget to eat as much sushi, udon noodles, and wagashi (Japanese sweets) as your belly can handle.</p>
            <p class="text-primary">With the plentiful options available in Tokyo, travelers are spoiled for choice when it comes to accommodation. For those on a budget, Tokyo has many great hostels and guest houses that provide both safety and comfort. Some of the newly built hostels have been awarded for their design, and more continue to open up. There are also capsule hotels, some of which are women-only. For more privacy, there are mid-tier and business hotels that provide convenience and all the basic amenities, making a great option for travelers who plan to spend most of their time out exploring the city. Luxury hotels in central Tokyo provide excellent 5-star service, city views and views over the water if you decide to stay in the Tokyo Bay area. Most of Tokyo’s luxury hotels are concentrated around the Tokyo Imperial Palace, Nihonbashi, Roppongi and Asakusa areas with convenient access to the city’s main sightseeing spots and shopping. There are also many hotels focused on art and design, and some host social events. If you’d like to try something a bit off-the-beaten-path, unique options outside the city include camping cabins and glamping.</p>
